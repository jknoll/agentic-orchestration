Cinematic slow-motion shot of a sleek BMW i8 in metallic silver emerging from shadows, scissor doors rising dramatically. Camera sweeps around the aerodynamic body as blue ambient lighting reflects off the carbon-fiber curves. Scene transitions to the i8 accelerating on a moonlit coastal highway, electric-blue headlights cutting through darkness. Voice-over: "Before the future arrived... we built it. BMW i8. The icon that redefined everything." Final shot: i8 silhouette against city skyline at dusk.
