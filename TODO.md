1) Update the video showcase: include all of the files and metadata generated in the output directory. [#7](https://github.com/jknoll/agentic-orchestration/issues/7) - IN PROGRESS 

2) Add a video carousel to the README.md with examples of some of the generated videos and a configuration which allows me to select the best videos for inclusion in the carousel.  

3) Add a screenshot of the running/rendered index.html file to the README.md to give a viewer a sense of the rendered application's user interface. 

4) Add step-by-step instructions for how to deploy to Vercel and how to test, including any permissions/API keys required, and step-by-step instructions for the Vercel signup process. Add these to a VERCEL.md file and link to this file from the main README.md file.
